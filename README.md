# chuck-chuck-norris-norris
This is a small project that shows a random list of Chuck Norris jokes, and allows you to
favorite them. I've not spent a lot of time on the visual aspect because I'm a terrible designer ðŸ¤¯

## Requirements
- A button that loads 10 random jokes in a list
- The possibility to favorite jokes
- A maximum of 10 unique jokes may be favorited
- A timer that adds a random joke to favorites every 5 seconds.

## Usage
I've spent very little time on tooling. No dev http server is included. A fast way to run the app
is to run `npx http-server` from the `public` directory.

If you want to make changes, run `npm install` and run Webpack by using `npm run build`
or `npm run watch`.
